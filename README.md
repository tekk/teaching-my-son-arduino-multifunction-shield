# Arduino UNO and Multifunction Shield - The Bomb

## Teaching my 6yo son and his friends Arduino...

- Working version, with just an Arduino UNO and Multifunction Shield. Only works with versions with buzzers that don't have continuous tone.
- The clones of the shield differ from some sellers.
- I have NOT included versions of the libraries that I've used in `platformio.ini`.
    - TODO need to add this in case some of the lib change syntax.
